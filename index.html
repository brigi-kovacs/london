      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p> As I look back now , after 4 years of living in London, I realise, these were my best and worst years so far. All the places I've been, the people I met, the experience I've got balance out the hard times, the dissapointments and failures I've been through.
      London is a wonderful city, full of innovation, beauty, knowledge, however, is too crowded, expensive, cloudy and competitive.

        </p>
      <h2> Working at DoubleTree Angel</h2>
      <p> I think, my best years in London were from January 2017 to September 2018, when I was working for the DoubleTree Angel. These were the times when I learnt,worked, got a lot of experience, partied, had fun and made friends the most, out of the 4 years since I've been here.

    Even though I came back, it's not the same without the people who left the team to pursue different career paths. I will always miss that team and I will always miss London, once I'm gone.
